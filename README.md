a simple type-writing game(GUI) with voice prompt for my little daughter, use tkinter+win32com.client, already pyinstaller to exe  file.

My daughter is almost 3 years-old, she is good at speaking & listening english, but letter recognization is terrible for her, so I create this python code. You can run it in python environment or click the exe file directly.

The UI looks terrible, you can see the "snapshot_UI" in project dir., if you're interested, you can download & modified the code to got it a good-looking.

The biggest advantage for this code is: it's easy to update the game content even you don't python, the only thing you need to do isï¼š add the pictures under "PIC" directory, and give right name for the picture.Modify the "PIC" path in the code. You can build your own type-writing practice for your children.

PS: Don't diss my UI, I just try the flow, it only takes me 4 hours.I know you can do it better ^_^!!!
