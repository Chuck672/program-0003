# program-0003
a simple type-writing game(GUI) with voice prompt for my little daughter, use tkinter+win32com.client, already pyinstaller to exe  file.
My daughter is almost 3 years-old, she is good at speaking & listening english, but letter recognization is terrible for her, so I create this python code. You can run it in python environment or click the exe file directly.
The UI looks terrible, if you're interested, you can download & modified the code to got it a good-looking.
